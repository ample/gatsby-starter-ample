# Ample's Gatsby Starter

This is the [_Gatsby Starter_](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/creating-a-starter/) that serves as the starting point for most Ample development projects. It is built from [Gatsby's Default Starter](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby-starter-default), with our pre-configured preferences to make getting started less cumbersome for you.

## Quick Start

To start a new project from this template, run the following command:

    $ gatsby new [PROJECT_NAME] ample/gatsby-starter-ample

Then navigate to the project:

    $ yarn develop

That will start a development server at [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000).

## Documentation

This starter uses [Docz](https://www.docz.site/) for documentation and (some) development. After getting the server up and running, visit [http://localhost:8000/docs](http://localhost:8000/docs) to get started. That page explains the features that ship with this starter.

You can also find more information about working with Gatsby within [Ample's Dev Playbook](https://dev-playbook.netlify.com/code/working-with-gatsby).
