import Icon from "."

# Icon

The `Icon` component generates an inline svg from `icons.js`, located in `src/components/image/icon`.

- _Prior to adding a new icon to `icons.js` run it through [svgr](https://react-svgr.com/playground/?expandProps=none)._

## Usage

Set the `name` prop as the icon name in `icons.js`.

<Icon name="arrow-down" />
