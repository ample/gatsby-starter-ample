# Image

The image tag is a utility wrapper that determines how to properly render an image. It also provides the ability to set a background texture (example below).

## Usage

The `src` attribute is what tells the image component how to render the image. See below for examples.

### Gatsby Image

If the `src` is a properly-formatted object, it will be rendered using [gatsby-image](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/packages/gatsby-image/). This occurs if the object contains a key called `childImageSharp`, which itself contains either a `fluid` or `fixed` object.

<Image src={fluidSrc} />

_Note: See fixtures for the structure of the props passed to this example._

### Native Image

If `src` is a string, it renders a native image, passing along any custom props directly to that `<img ... />` element. This is useful when using SVG images, as they are not transformed into objects during the build.

**This approach should only be used when working with images that Gatsby Image does not transform, like SVG files.**

<Image src={nativeSrc} />
