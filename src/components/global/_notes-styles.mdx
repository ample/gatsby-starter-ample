# Global Styles

This component combines normalized CSS with the default brand. Styles can be
found in `components/global/styles`. Once set and except for bug fixes, these
files shouldn't be edited since they may break dependent component styles.

## No Import Required

Global Styles are available to every component and story automatically, without
import. This component is not meant to be used in production outside of the
`<Layout />` file.

## Media Queries

The type styles adjust to mobile-friendly sizes at the `md` breakpoint.

## Size Units

Use rems wherever possible. `1rem` = `10px`

## Text Size Utility Classes

There are optional text-size classes: `text-sm`, `text-md`, `text-lg`. You can
use `text-md` to reset the font size back to default. The actual size of the
font will vary based on the font family. See Canvas for details.

## &lt;a>

Links inherit their parent component's style and color.

## `\n` Character

Add the `newline` class to elements whose data includes newline (`\n`)
characters. The `HTML` utility includes this class by default.

## &lt;img>, &lt;svg>

Images are set to `display: inline-block; vertical-align: middle;` to remove the
default bottom white space.
