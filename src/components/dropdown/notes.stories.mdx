# Dropdown

The dropdown component is really more of a set of composable elements that can be used together to build a dropdown menu. It is comprised on three components:

- `<Dropdown />`: A wrapper that controls the visibility of the interior components.

- `<DropdownTrigger />`: A wrapper around a trigger, and doesn't offer any real functional benefit at this time. It lives as a placeholder, should we want to bake functionality into it in the future.

- `<DropdownMenu />`: The element which toggles its visibility based on interaction with the wrapping `<Dropdown />` component.

## Usage

<Preview>
  <Story name="Dropdown">
    <>
      <Dropdown>
        <DropdownTrigger>Hover over me</DropdownTrigger>
        <DropdownMenu items={fixture} />
      </Dropdown>
      <p>
        Here's some other content to demonstrate that the menu is absolutely-positioned by default.
      </p>
    </>
    `
  </Story>
</Preview>

## Properties

Here are each component's properties:

### Dropdown

The dropdown doesn't render anything to the DOM that isn't passed to it.

<Props of={Dropdown} />

### DropdownMenu

The menu will automatically render a set of items, each of which are passed to the `<Link />` component.

<Props of={DropdownMenu} />

### DropdownTrigger

Like the parent dropdown, the trigger only renders what is presented to it as children.

<Props of={DropdownTrigger} />
