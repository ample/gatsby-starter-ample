# Dropdown

The dropdown component is really more of a set of composable elements that can be used together to build a dropdown menu. It is comprised on three components:

- `<Dropdown />`: A wrapper that controls the visibility of the interior components.

- `<DropdownTrigger />`: A wrapper around a trigger, and doesn't offer any real functional benefit at this time. It lives as a placeholder, should we want to bake functionality into it in the future.

- `<DropdownMenu />`: The element which toggles its visibility based on interaction with the wrapping `<Dropdown />` component.

## Usage

<div>
  <Dropdown>
    <DropdownTrigger>Hover over me</DropdownTrigger>
    <DropdownMenu items={dropdownFixture} />
  </Dropdown>
  <p>Here's some other content to demonstrate that the menu is absolutely-positioned by default.</p>
</div>
