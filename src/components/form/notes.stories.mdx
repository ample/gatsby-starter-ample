# Form

Forms are built as a three-level system, following this logic:

- Forms have many field groups
- Field groups have many fields

The form accepts configuration for the entire system and passes it down to a fields controller (i.e. the _group_), which normalizes the attributes and renders the appropriate field component.

<Form {...fixture} />
