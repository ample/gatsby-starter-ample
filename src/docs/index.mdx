# Getting Started

Welcome to the documentation site for this project. This site serves to document usage instructions for developers, while also providing a test playground for QA and preview purposes.

This project uses the [GatsbyJS](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/) static site generator. It was built from [Ample's Gastby Starter](https://github.com/ample/gatsby-starter-ample), makes use of [Ample's Component Library](https://gatsby-theme-ample-components.netlify.com/), and uses [Docz](https://www.docz.site/) for documentation.

## Working with Gatsby

Gatsby is extremely flexible out of the box. Because of that, Ample has put in place some specific practices around working with Gatsby. This helps reduce duplicate and boilerplate code, and makes it easier to jump from project to project at Ample.

For an in-depth exploration on how to work with Gatsby, visit [Ample's Dev Playbook](https://dev-playbook.netlify.com/code/working-with-gatsby).

## Third-Party Services

Here are the third-party services we're using:

- [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/) (Static Site Generator)
- [Docz](https://www.docz.site/) (Documentation)

## Component Library

You have access to Ample's Component Library, which can help reduce the duplicate and boilerplate code you'd otherwise have to include. You can read more about Ample's Component Library on [its doc site](https://gatsby-theme-ample-components.netlify.com/).

## Generator Utility

This project has a generator for quickly scaffolding the site. The version that's included with this project is simple. You can generate one of the following:

- Component
- Section
- Template
- Fragment

The generator takes a command and a name, for example:

    $ ./.bin/generator.js component hello-world

It doesn't do anything intelligent â€” it simply copies the boilerplate files into the appropriate directory.
