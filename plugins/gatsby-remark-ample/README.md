# gatsby-remark-ample

gatsby-remark-ample is a Gatsby plugin that sits on top of [gatsby-transformer-remark](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/packages/gatsby-transformer-remark/) to provide a few frills to help [Ample](https://www.helloample.com/) developers build Gatsby sites more efficiently.

If you are working with this plugin and aren't familiar with the gatsby-transformer-remark plugin, that's the place to start. Otherwise, the sections below will walk through usage and features.

## Install

This plugin is part of Ample's Gatsby starter. It is already configured in `gatsby-config.js`, with commented options. See below for an explanation of the options.

**IMPORTANT! To work properly, you must write your own type definitions.** More on this below.

## Options

- `contentSrc`: The directory in which your markdown files live. This should be the topmost parent, as it can only be a single directory. **There is a major assumption in this plugin â€” that your content is segmented within the `contentSrc` directory by another directory, presumably indicating its type.** (e.g. If pages go in `src/content/pages` and posts go in `src/content/posts`, then `src/content` is the `contentSrc` value.)
- `imageExtensions`: An array of image file extensions that should be processed as images.
- `imageSrc`: The directory that is treated as the root for image file paths.
- `imageSuffix`: The unique suffix on keys that should be processed as images.
- `markdownSuffix`: The unique suffix on keys that should be processed as markdown.
- `modelField`: The unique top-level property key that should be used as explicit instruction on which query the file should be available.
- `plugins`: An array of plugin dependencies. See [Plugins](#plugins) for more details about how plugins fit into the lifecycle of this plugin.
- `projectRoot`: The root directory of the project. This is the base from which `filePath` is set upon child nodes. As long as you are using this plugin from either the `plugins` directory or the `node_modules` directory, you won't have to mess with this. Otherwise, set it to `path.join(__dirname)`.
- `seoField`: The unique top-level property key that houses SEO data.

## How it works

This is built on top of gatsby-transformer-remark. It takes the frontmatter from a `MarkdownRemark` node and creates a child of that node from the frontmatter, after further processing those properties and adding a few others.

It also then stores that transformed frontmatter on the `MarkdownRemark` node at `fields.processed_frontmatter`.

Here are the primary concepts we'll walk through to explain how this is working:

- Structured Data
- Type Definitions
- New Fields
- Markdown Processing
- Image Processing

### Structured Data

One of the key benefits of this plugin is that it groups local content files into their individual queries, which provides three key benefits:

1. Makes querying data by type much simpler (no filters required).
2. Removes properties that are irrelevant to a group of objects.
3. Adds markdown, image, and SEO processing.

The way structured data works is that it looks for a field at the top level of the frontmatter in nodes processed as `MarkdownRemark`. (This is the `modelField` option.) If it finds the field, it will create a new node of that type, maintaining a relationship to the `MarkdownRemark` node.

#### Creating structured child nodes

Say there's a file in `src/content/pages/index.md` that looks like this:

```md
---
title: Home Page
model: Page
---

Hello world ...
```

The node could be queried through `allPage` or `page` because `Page` was the value of the `model` field. (`model` is the default model field key.)

```graphql
{
  page {
    title
  }
}
```

This node is a _child_ of the `MarkdownRemark` node and only brings the processed frontmatter with it. For example, `html` would not work in the example above, as `html` is only accessible through the parent `MarkdownRemark` node.

#### Accessing structured nodes through the `MarkdownRemark` node

If you want to work with fields from the `MarkdownRemark` node _and_ the new structured node, there are two ways to go about it.

The first way is to access the child node following Gatsby's parent-child relationship convention:

```graphql
{
  markdownRemark {
    childPage {
      title
    }
  }
}
```

The second way requires additional configuration using the `models` option. If you pass the appropriate model through to the plugin, the child will also be accessible through a custom `processed_frontmatter` field.

To set that up, first make sure the model is being passed into the plugin as an option:

```js
// in gatsby-config.js
module.exports = {
  plugins: [
    // ...
    {
      resolve: `gatsby-remark-ample`,
      options: {
        models: ["Page"]
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

Then the page will be available through `fields.processed_frontmatter` as its type:

```graphql
{
  markdownRemark {
    fields {
      processed_frontmatter {
        ... on Page {
          title
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Type Definitions

This plugin **assumes that the types you're using have already been defined.** In the past, this plugin has handled type definitions, but it caused potential conflicts when types are defined outside the context of this plugin.

We recommend using the [gatsby-ample-schema](https://github.com/ample/gatsby-starter-ample/tree/main/plugins/gatsby-ample-schema) plugin to easily define the types you're working with.

Because Gatsby [automatically infers types](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/reference/graphql-data-layer/schema-customization/#automatic-type-inference), you don't have to explicitly define every field, including those that this plugin sets. However, make note to avoid conflicts with fields set by this plugin. See the next section on new fields for more info.

### Added frontmatter fields

In addition to the original frontmatter fields and the newly processed fields, this plugin adds some logical fields to support the way we work, including:

- `slug`: The filename without the extension.
- `slugPath`: The relative path with the file slug from the segmented content directory.
- `pathPrefix`: The slug path, without the last segment.
- `filePath`: The relative path of the file from the root of the project. This depends on the `projectRoot` option being the absolute path to the Gatsby project. (More on this below the example.)

Consider the example above, but for a page that lives at `src/content/pages/about/company.md`:

```md
---
title: About our Company
model: Page
---
```

And add those fields to the query:

```graphql
{
  page {
    slug
    slugPath
    filePath
  }
}
```

The results would be:

- `slug`: `company`
- `slugPath`: `about/company`
- `filePath`: `src/content/pages/about/company.md`

#### The Purpose of `filePath`

It may seem like an odd addition to put `filePath` attribute on each of these nodes. This is done to work with services like Forestry that use a file path as a way to association markdown files to one another.

This provides the ability to easily map GraphQL fields across nodes in Gatsby using [the mapping feature](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/gatsby-config/#mapping-node-types).

Say you have a file at `src/content/posts/my-post.md` with this frontmatter:

```md
---
title: My Post
model: Post
author: src/content/authors/sad-clown.md
---
```

And the `author` field points to a file that exists, that is created into an `Author` child node. For example:

```md
---
title: Sad Clown
model: Author
---
```

You'd then be able to map the fields together in `gatsby-config.js` like so:

```js
module.exports = {
  mapping: {
    "Post.author": "Author.filePath"
  },
  plugins: [
    // ...
  ]
}
```

Then you would receive the `Author` object as the `author` field on the post in your GraphQL query:

```graphql
{
  post {
    author {
      title # returns "Sad Clown"
    }
  }
}
```

### Markdown Processing

gatsby-transformer-remark processes markdown, but only in the main content area of markdown files. We wanted to be able to process markdown within frontmatter. The concept here is that we'd create a unique key suffix that would tell this plugin to treat the field as a markdown field, to process it and save the resulting HTML string as a new key, without the suffix.

The default value of `markdownSuffix` is `_md`. So, say our example above had a frontmatter field for a sidebar that we wanted processed as markdown. We'd want to append the field's key with `_md`:

```md
---
title: About our Company
model: Page
sidebar_md: |-
  # Hello World

  Lorem ipsum ...
---
```

When it comes time to write the query, `sidebar_md` will return the original string, while `sidebar` will contain the HTML string.

```graphql
{
  page {
    sidebar_md # Returns original markdown string
    sidebar # Returns HTML string
  }
}
```

Note that the processed HTML field is not available on the `MarkdownRemark` node:

```graphql
{
  markdownRemark {
    frontmatter {
      sidebar_md
      sidebar # Does not exist!
    }
  }
}
```

### Image Processing

This plugin supports both local and remote images.

#### Local Images

Local image processing works almost identically to markdown processing, with a few exceptions:

- It relies on `gatsby-remark-relative-images`, and `gatsby-remark-images` for transforming image path strings into objects that can be used with gatsby-image.
- It will ignore image paths that don't end in the accepted extensions whitelist. This is so we don't try to process images we can't process, like SVG files.
- It will only process values that start with the proper path separator (e.g. `/`) character, indicating that it is a path to a file.

This is highly opinionated to work with content management systems that write images to the file system, such as [NetlifyCMS](https://www.netlifycms.org/) or [Forestry](https://www.forestry.io/).

Because of that, this process is involved, opinionated, and a little goofy. So let's look at how this transformation works:

First, this plugin scans frontmatter for keys that end in the `imageSuffix` (default: `_src`). When it finds one, if the value is a string that ends in an acceptable extension, it next identifies the relative path from the markdown file to the physical image file. (That's where `imageSrc` comes in handy.) If all of these items come together, the plugin then writes the value to a key without the suffix.

For example, if our markdown file had an `image_src` field:

```md
---
title: About our Company
model: Page
image_src: "/uploads/our-company.jpg
---
```

And assuming there is a physical file at `static/uploads/our-company.jpg`, then the result looks something like this:

```md
---
title: About our Company
model: Page
image_src: "/uploads/our-company.jpg
image: "../../../static/uploads/our-company.jpg
---
```

When `gatsby-remark-images` then processes this node, it will transform the `image` property into a `childImageSharp` object if it can find the physical file.

But before `gatsby-remark-images` does its thing, `gatsby-remark-relative-images` also runs through our new node. Its responsibility is to look through body content of the markdown files and convert any items that would become `<img />` tags to adjust their `src` attribute to a relative path from the markdown file to the physical image file.

#### Remote Images

Remote images are identified similarly as local images, using the `imageSuffix` setting. If the path/URL to the image begins with `http` or `//` then it is processed as a remote image using `gatsby-source-filesystem` and `gatsby-remark-images`.

## Plugins

This plugin accepts an array of plugin dependencies. Each dependency is expected to have a `remark-plugin.js` file in its root directory. That file is to contain a series of exported APIs that enable the plugin to hook into the lifecycle of the node creation process provided by this plugin.

For example, say you want to add a `url` field to objects with the `Post` object before it is created. If that logic were to be included in a `gatsby-plugin-posts` plugin, you'd first specify the dependency in `gatsby-config.js`:

```js
{
  resolve: `gatsby-remark-ample`,
  options: {
    plugins: [`gatsby-plugin-posts`]
  }
}
```

`gatsby-plugin-posts` would be expected to have a `remark-plugin.js` file in its root directory. That file may look something like this:

```js
const get = require("lodash/get")

exports.initNode = node => {
  if (get(node, "internal.type") !== "Post") return node
  node.url = "..."
  return node
}
```

The important piece to note here is that the returned object is used by `gatsby-remark-ample` as the foundation for creating the node that will ultimately become available through GraphQL queries. That typically means it's better to manipulate the input node rather than creating a new one.

### Available APIs

The only API available currently is `initNode`. This is run before the node is created, though after its SEO node is created and attached. It is sent a single argument, which is the node object. That object can be manipulated and returned.
